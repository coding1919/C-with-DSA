// Operator Precedence(priority)
// !, ++, -- (unary operator) -> first R to L
// *, /, % -> second L to R
// +, - -> third L to R
// <, <=, >=, > -> fourth L to R
// ==, != -> fifth L to R
// && -> sixth L to R
// || -> seventh L to R
// = (assignment operator) -> eighth R to L

// bitwise operator priority is in between third and fourth place
